# Choices App

Link to use the App: [https://t-cube2512.github.io/choices/](https://t-cube2512.github.io/choices/)

**Choices** is an app designed to help users who are currently using a test-based book or PDF. Instead of navigating back and forth between the questions and answer key, you can use this app to simulate the question answering experience in a more efficient way. Don't suffer like I did.

## Features

- **Customizable Question Range**: You can set the start and end question numbers for your test.
- **Time per Question**: Specify how long you'd like to answer each question (in seconds).
- **Dynamic Choices**: Choose how many answer choices (2-20) you'd like to have for each question.
- **Question Timer**: Each question is timed, and the app automatically moves to the next question when the timer runs out or an answer is selected.
- **Review Mode**: After completing the test, you can review your answers and mark them as right or wrong.
- **Score Calculation**: After the review phase, the app will show your score based on the number of correct answers.

(p.s. I am trying soo hard not to get angry over a measly PDF issue, but If you are a PDF Author and You are trying to make your PDFs good and easy to access, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE USING YOUR PDF FOR PRACTICING QUESTIONS, Make sure to add a way to navigate BACK to your Question page after clicking the answer page Href to navigate to the Answer key section... Im Trying to get practice tests done for comptia here, and STILL cant scroll back and forth the questions and answer page...)
