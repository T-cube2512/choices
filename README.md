# Choices App

**Choices** is an app designed to help users who are currently using a test-based book or PDF. Instead of navigating back and forth between the questions and answer key, you can use this app to simulate the question answering experience in a more efficient and focused way.

## Features

- **Customizable Question Range**: You can set the start and end question numbers for your test.
- **Time per Question**: Specify how long you'd like to answer each question (in seconds).
- **Dynamic Choices**: Choose how many answer choices (2-4) you'd like to have for each question.
- **Question Timer**: Each question is timed, and the app automatically moves to the next question when the timer runs out or an answer is selected.
- **Review Mode**: After completing the test, you can review your answers and mark them as right or wrong.
- **Score Calculation**: After the review phase, the app will show your score based on the number of correct answers.
